# Introduction 

<p> This project simulates a real-world e-commerce data environment where data is created , stored, managed, and automated to gain the desired insights.

# Database Design and Implementation

## Entity Relationship Diagram

![E-Commerce Entity Relationship Diagram](Images/ERD.jpg "Figure 1- Entity Relationship Diagram")

<p> **Figure 1** shows the E-R diagram that simulates a real-world e-commerce data ecosystem, capturing the detailed relationships between entities and attributes essential for facilitating online transactions. In addition, it provides a comprehensive view of the e-commerce system, which serves as a platform for users to browse products, make purchases, and securely complete their payments. </p>


## Reltional Mapping Diagrams


### Product Supplied By Supplier

<p> This relation is important for inventory management, reflecting the real-world scenario where a single supplier might provide various products, but each product is supplied by only one specific supplier **Figure 6**. It is essential to understand how products are sourced in a database model, where tracking the source of each product is crucial. The relation helps track inventory sources, manage supplier relationships, and ensure product availability.</p>

## Logical Schema

### Customers 

Customers ($\underline{\text{Cust\_ID}}$, Cust_First_Name, Cust_Last_Name, Cust_Building_Name, Cust_Street_Name, Cust_Zip_Code, Cust_Email, Cust_Phone_Number, Cust_Country_Code)

### Products 

Products ($\underline{\text{Product\_ID}}$, *Discount_Code*, *Category_ID*, *Supplier_ID* ,Product_Name, Product_Availability, Product_Price)


## Physical Schema Creation 

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide' , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE , eval=FALSE}
#Creating the db schema in SQL
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "ecommerce.db")

sql_file <- readLines("dbScript.sql")

for (sql_command in sql_file) {
  if (sql_command!=""){
    print(sql_command)
    dbExecute(con,sql_command)
    print("-------------DONE---------")
  }
}
```
